# 📘 JSON Notebook Examples – DefectDetect

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to work with JSON files exported from the DefectDetect application.

## 🧪 What you'll find

- ✅ Load and display all exported patches from a collective JSON
- ✅ Filter and display only patches containing a specific class (e.g., Defect 4)
- ✅ Works with both Google Colab and local Jupyter environments

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3
- `opencv-python`
- `json`
- (Optional) `google.colab.patches` if using in Colab

## ▶️ Running the notebook

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or upload to Google Colab.
2. Replace example paths (`/content/...`) with paths to your exported folders.
3. Run cells and inspect patch data visually.
